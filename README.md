# CODCallerBOT
Call of Duty Modern Warfare stats Discord bot. Once added to a server all members will be able to call and react with the bot's assigned functions.

**Version 1(month) .0(production level: ground) .1(upload #)**
  - So far just running test on the bot. It has three working client events:
    - Alert when bot is ready
    - Alert when member joins
    - Alert when member leaves
  - I have uploaded a virtual environment to access the Discord API
